# üáÆüá≥ India General Election 2024: A Data Analysis Dashboard

---

## üìä Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of the India General Election 2024 results. The primary goal was to transform raw, unstructured electoral data into a structured and insightful dashboard that allows for deep exploration of the election outcomes.

The process began with the collection of raw data on a **constituency-by-constituency basis**, including party affiliations, vote counts, and candidate information. This data was then cleaned and loaded into a **MySQL database**, where I designed a normalized schema to ensure data integrity and facilitate complex querying.

Leveraging the power of SQL, I executed various queries to calculate key metrics, identify trends, and prepare the data for visualization. The final dataset was then integrated into **Power BI**, where I designed and developed a dynamic, multi-page dashboard. The dashboard empowers users to interact with the data, uncover insights, and understand the political landscape from multiple levels of detail, from a national overview down to individual constituencies.
